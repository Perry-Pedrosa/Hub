## About Me
Hi, I'm Perry and I, like you, have a passion for data. 
My journey into the world of data began when I was still working in Risk Management which was a business area that had no interest in finding out where problems lied through data and chose to instead use subject matter experts.. although both have their place, using data can take you so much further in terms of deep dives and visualisations. 

### Educaton

**Level 6 BSc Data Science (*Ongoing*)**

Ongoing Module Grades:
